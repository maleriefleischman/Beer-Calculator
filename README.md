# Beer-Calculator

This project incorporates HTML/CSS(Bootstrap, Bootswatch) and Javascript(Jquery, Jquery Validator, Jquery Tether) to create an interactive calculator that determines how many calories you need to maintain weight based on Height, Weight, and Sex and then determines how many beers it would take to meet that caloric requirement.
